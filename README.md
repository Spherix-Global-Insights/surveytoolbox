## Update Notes
### 2023.11.10
- Added the check_value function which works similarly to check_seen except it checks for a particular value instead of missing values
- Multiple functions (ex. check_seen, check_seen_multi, check_value) can now take in multiple conditions and check it for its respective variable
- Added the stack_loops function
- Error report now shows the function that was used instead of just the variables
